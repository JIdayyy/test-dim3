# Dim3 Technical test

This is my version of the technical test for Dim3

To run the application you have to create a .env file at the root of the project.
``` 
cd test-dim3
```
``` 
touch .env
```

And then set up the VITE_API_URL environment variable.
``` 
VITE_API_URL=http://example.com
```
---

Now you have to install the dependencies with

npm:
``` 
npm install
```

yarn:
``` 
npm install
```

Once it is done you can run this command to run the application in development mode:
npm:
``` 
npm run dev
```

yarn:
``` 
yarn dev
```

---

To build the project run this
npm:
``` 
npm run build
```

yarn:
``` 
yarn build
```

And this command to start it in production mode
npm:
``` 
npm preview
```

yarn:
``` 
yarn preview
```
